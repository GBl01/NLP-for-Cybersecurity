# NLP for Cybersecurity (Group Project â€“ 3 Members)

Fine-tuned **BERT**, **UnixCoder**, and **SecureShellBERT** for **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** on SSH session data.  
Mapped commands and flags to **MITRE ATT&CK tactics** and applied inference to detect suspicious or adversarial behaviors.  

**Technologies:** Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, BERT, UnixCoder  
**Dataset:** SSH session logs labeled with MITRE tactics  
**Skills learned:** NLP fine-tuning, domain adaptation, model evaluation in cybersecurity
